Features
--------
This automation ties together three different services: Smartsheet, Webex Meetings/Webinars and Webex Messaging bot. It helps a lot if you are running many webinars, especially in series, especially with multiple people collaborating.

This automation supports:

- Create and update Webex Webinars based on information in Smartsheet
- Reports status via bot to a Webex space
- Control with Webex bot adaptive cards
- Creation can be triggered by bot command or by schedule
- Customizable webinar parameters
- Attendee link, host key and registrant count updated into Smartsheet


How it works
------------

- Collect all webinar information in a smartsheet, one webinar per row. Include details like webinar title, description, date and time, hosts, panelists etc. The smartsheet can be shared by multiple people for teamwork.
- Check out individual webinars for creation by changing the ``Create`` field to ``yes``. Save the smartsheet.
- Mention the @bot in the Webex room and click ``Schedule now`` button.
- The scheduling will be triggered and the bot will report back after some seconds (or minutes, depending on your amount of webinars).
